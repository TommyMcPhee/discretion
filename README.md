# discretion

This code is used to build the audiovisual stereo instrument used in Discretion!
This project uses the OpenFrameworks environment (https://openframeworks.cc/download/). It can be built on Windows, MacOS, or Linux by utilizing the ProjectGenerator to make a new project (or simply configuring the default files and libraries in the same way), replacing the /src file with this source code and adding the shader files to /bin/data. This project uses OpenGL version 3.2.
